Introduction To Dynamic Programming:
Dynamic programming is basically, recursion(parent of DP) plus using common sense(Base Cases + Choice Diagram).
What it means is that recursion allows you to express the value of a 
function in terms of other values of that function.

Memoization:Avoid Recomputation Issue in TOP-DOWN approach

-Here we need to store the results of the sub problems to be used in the further calculations.
The idea is before making the recursive call check for the solution in the exisitng memory.
if it is there use it else go for it.
