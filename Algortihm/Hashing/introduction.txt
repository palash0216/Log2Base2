If we have elements like 2,4,6,8..
we have to place these elements in the array likewise we are following the criteria : F(x)=x
But this is not space efficient.
Therefore we will use % (modulo) here.
So it will always provide the index within the range
F(x)=x%size;
if we have to insert 24 in array of size 7
then 24%7=3 therefore we insert it at 3
if we have a array like :
14 8 -1 24 -1 -1 -1     -> size 7
and we want to search for 8
then loc(in array)=data%size; -> 8%7=1 ->TRUE
if we want to delete use the same forumula and replace the value by -1.
what is collision in hashing?
Two or more values were pointing the same location under %.
How to Contorl Collision.
Suppose we have an array.
size =5 -> 10 -1 -1 13 9
insert 15 -> 15%5=0 but 10 is already there -> collison occurs 
if it happens than go for the next index.
array -> 10 15 -1 13 9 
now insert 20 same process will repeated again.
In linear Probing If Collision Occur then we use F(x)=(x+i)%size where i=1,2,3,4,......
